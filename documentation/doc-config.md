The OpenME software kit configuration controls the behavior of the OpenME software kit, allowing its user and developers to customize their instance of OpenME for best performance and stability. 

Configurations of OpenME software kit are standard .ini files as used in many other PHP applications. These configurations, when used, are manipulated by the core-file functions library. Configurations can be stored in databases for faster access and reduced file I/O.
